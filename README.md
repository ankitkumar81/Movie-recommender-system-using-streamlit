The recommender system is a simple algorithm that aims to provide the most relevant information to the user by detecting patterns in the dataset. The purpose of recommender systems is to search for content that is of interest to humans.

In addition, it contains many elements to create a personalized list of useful and interesting content that is unique to each user / individual. 
Recommender systems are artificial intelligence-based algorithms that scan all possible options and create a custom list of items that are interesting and relevant to a person. These results are based on your profile, search / browsing history, what others with similar characteristics / demographics are watching, and how likely you are to see these movies.

<h3>Types of Recommender systems:-</h3>
The two main types are:<br>
(i)   	Collaborative Filtering<br>
(ii)Content based Filtering

<br>(i)Collaborative Filtering tends to find what similar users would like and the recommendations to be provided and in order to classify the users into clusters of similar types and recommend each user according to the preference of its cluster. The main idea that governs the collaborative methods is that through past user-item interactions when processed through the system, it becomes sufficient to detect similar users or similar items to make predictions based on these estimated facts and insights. 

(ii)Content- based filtering approach uses item features to recommend other items similar to what the user likes and also based on their previous actions or explicit feedback. If we consider the example for a movies recommender system, the additional information can be, the age, the sex, the job or any other personal information for users as well as the category, the main actors, the duration or other characteristics for the movies i.e the items.
